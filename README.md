                       #NBA dataset Project
  
  For this project , I have decided to delve into the NBA, with stats from 1950
  
  until the present time. This dataset contains all of the NBA players for the 
  
  passed 60 years.  Everything from their weight and height to their season 
  
  stats . I can look into how the nba has evolved over the years whether it be 
  
  physical or increased capabilities.



  I chose this set because of my knowledge and love of the game.
